# Weekend Redux Feedback Loop



##  Description

The **Weekend Redux Feedback Loop** is a full-stack application that allows users to submit feedback in a multi-step form. The application captures data on the user's feeling, understanding, and support, along with any comments they provide. After the feedback is submitted, it is stored in a database and can be reviewed by an admin.

This project utilizes Redux to manage the application's state across multiple views and stores the form data until it is submitted. The app features a review page for users to see their inputs before submission, along with optional validations.
